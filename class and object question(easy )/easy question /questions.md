Here's a categorized list of **30 Python programming questions** related to the **`object` class and object-oriented programming** in Python, divided by **difficulty levels**: Basic, Medium, and Advanced.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level (10 Questions)**

These focus on understanding class and object fundamentals.

1. **Create a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Create an object and display its attributes.**
2. **Write a class `Car` with a method `start_engine()` that prints "Engine started". Create an object and call the method.**
3. **Create a class `Rectangle` that takes `length` and `breadth` and calculates area.**
4. **Write a program where you define a class `Dog` with a method `bark()` that prints "Woof!"**
5. **Define a class `Student` with default values for attributes using a constructor.**
6. **Create a class with a class variable `count` that keeps track of how many objects are created.**
7. **Make a class `Book` and take user input to assign values to its attributes.**
8. **Write a program to check the type of object using `isinstance()`.**
9. **Create two objects of a class `Laptop` and assign different attribute values.**
10. **Write a class with a method that returns a string representation using `__str__()`.**

## ðŸ”¸ **Medium Level (10 Questions)**

These involve more control and interaction between objects and methods.

11. **Create a class `BankAccount` with `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods and a balance attribute.**
12. **Write a class `Employee` with a method to calculate annual salary including a bonus.**
13. **Use inheritance to create a base class `Shape` and derive classes `Circle` and `Square`.**
14. **Override the `__eq__` method to compare two `Point(x, y)` objects.**
15. **Create a class `Library` that keeps track of books using a list and has `add_book()` and `list_books()` methods.**
16. **Write a class `Temperature` that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.**
17. **Implement a class that uses `__len__()` to return a custom value.**
18. **Make a class with a private attribute and demonstrate access via a method.**
19. **Create a class `ShoppingCart` that holds multiple item objects and calculates total cost.**
20. **Implement a class with a static method to validate a user password.**

## ðŸ”º **Advanced Level (10 Questions)**

These challenge your understanding of advanced OOP concepts.

21. **Create a metaclass that automatically adds a `class_name` attribute to any class using it.**
22. **Write a class `Vector` that supports addition and scalar multiplication using operator overloading.**
23. **Design a class that uses properties with getters and setters to manage access to a sensitive attribute.**
24. **Implement method chaining using `return self` pattern in a builder-style class.**
25. **Demonstrate use of multiple inheritance and how Python resolves the method resolution order (MRO).**
26. **Create a class with a custom iterator using `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.**
27. **Write a class that tracks object creation and deletion using `__init__()` and `__del__()`.**
28. **Implement a class that prevents direct instantiation using an abstract base class (`ABC`).**
29. **Write a class that overrides `__call__()` so its object can be called like a function.**
30. **Use composition (not inheritance) to build a class that contains and uses another class's functionality.**
